Package `gghdr` provides the framework to visualize Highest Density Regions (HDR) with the grammar of graphics as implemented in `ggplot2`. There are several statistical methods (viz. box plots, summary plots or letter value plots) to summarize a distribution by region of the sample space covering certain probability. The method of summarizing a distribution using highest density regions are useful for plotting multimodal distributions. Highest density regions may include disjoint subsets each covering a local mode. This work extends the functionality of `ggplot2` by making a combination of calls to new `stat_*` and `geom_*` functions. The `stat_*` functions are inherited from the R package `hdrcde` and `geom_*` functions are created to produce the new plotting symbols. This package enhances users' ability to customize and combine highest density regions (through box plots, scatter plots and rug plots) with other ggplot2 objects to highlight different features of a distribution.
